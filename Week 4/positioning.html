       <div class="actext">While the game looks great, it fell short in the main combat system. Something that has always been important to any fan of the AC series. It was just really dissapointing after all that time to be let down by something so basic. Also, the mechanics felt clunky and awkward. They focused more on brutal finishing moves but didn't bother to give you a way to counter incoming attacks.

       <p class="coldwartext">With an all new campaign, explosive multiplayer and a reimagined zombies experience, Call Of Duty Black Ops Cold War has something for everyone. The one and only complaint I have is that there's no online co-op campaign. I'm sure Treyarch will have a patch for this shortly. Even if they don't, there's still plenty to do in Cold War.

       <p class="milestext">Taking a more personal approach than the previous game, we follow Miles as he's trying to determine his identity as Spider-Man. The game allows Miles the chance to try, fail, grow and ultimately inspire. Plenty of unlockable costumes to pay homage to Mile's comicbook wardrobe as well.</p>
